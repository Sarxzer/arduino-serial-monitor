Ide settings:

- Set the board to `ESP32 Dev Module`
- Don't touch all the other settings
- Set the serial port to the one that the ESP32 is connected to (like `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `COM3`)
- Set the baud rate to `9600`

To upload the code to the ESP32, press the `boot` button on the ESP32, then press the `upload` button in the IDE. (DO NOT release the `boot` button until the upload is complete)
The code will be uploaded to the ESP32 and it will start running.
